headless: true                # true = ninja mode, false = watch the browser do its thing
sort_by: "newest"             # "newest" = fresh meat first, "highest"/"lowest" = rating order, "relevance" = Google's BS algorithm

overwrite_existing: false     # true = nuke & replace old reviews, false = just add the new stuff

# MONGODB CONFIGURATION
use_mongodb: true             # true = store in a real database like a professional, false = JSON only like a caveman
mongodb:
  uri: "mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/"  # FIX THIS or weep when it fails
  database: "reviews"         # Adjust if you're particular about your DB naming
  collection: "google_reviews" # Where the magic happens

# JSON BACKUP OPTIONS (don't disable unless you enjoy data loss)
backup_to_json: true          # KEEP THIS TRUE unless you hate yourself and love regret

seen_ids_path: "google_reviews.ids" # Tracks what we've already scraped

# DATE HANDLING (trust me, you want this)

# browser_timeout: 30           # How long to wait before declaring a page DEAD
# max_reviews: 1000             # Cap the scrape count (0 = UNLIMITED POWER!)
